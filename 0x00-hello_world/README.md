# C Programming Tasks

This directory contains a collection of C programming tasks and scripts. Below, you'll find descriptions of each task, along with the corresponding scripts or programs. Some tasks are considered mandatory, while others are advanced.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is organized as follows:

- `task1_preprocessor.sh`: Script to run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result to another file.

- `task2_compile_no_link.sh`: Script to compile a C file without linking.

- `task3_generate_assembly.sh`: Script to generate assembly code from a C file.

- `task4_compile_cisfun.sh`: Script to compile a C file into an executable named "cisfun."

- `task5_puts_message.c`: C program that prints a message using the `puts` function.

- `task6_printf_message.c`: C program that prints a message using the `printf` function.

- `task7_sizeof_types.c`: C program that prints the sizes of various data types.

- `task8_custom_message.c`: C program that prints a custom message to standard error without using `printf` or `puts`.

**Please note that tasks 7 and 8 are advanced and optional.**

## Task Descriptions
